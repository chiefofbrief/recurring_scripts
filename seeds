This file contains notes saved from news analysis. These 'seeds' serve as the starting point/reminder of items to investigate further. Here is what we care about the most:

1. Stocks with notable price drops (might be a buying opportunity pending fundamental and sentiment analysis). Popular stocks (i.e., brand names) are ideal since the price may be more likely to rebound. 

2. Stocks that are strongly correlated with AI, whether its in the application (e.g., foundation models, AI startups) or infrastructure layers (e.g., training data, cloud/storage, hardware (GPUs, TPUs, semiconductors), data centers, electricity, etc.). 

3. Stocks that may benefit or suffer from reflexivity (reflexivity = investors’ beliefs and actions influence prices, and those price changes then reinforce or alter investors’ beliefs, creating feedback loops between perception and market reality).
